You don't have to be chronically online to see Japan's [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) in our culture. Instagram seems to be chock full with pictures of post-grad Japan trips. Ramen and sushi have become all the rage among foodies looking for a perfect meal. You'd be hard pressed to find many Gen-Z who haven't watched the likes of Attack on Titan or Demon Slayer. The quip that simply adding the word *Japanese* to any normal picture's caption suddenly increases its perceived "aura" is real.

Yes, the Western idolization of Japan is just that. Japan isn't innately special among the many diverse cultures in the world. However as a victim of the Japanese wave, I  understand why it might seem that way.

## Is Japan special?
I became a part of the global anime craze starting in middle school. From stories of medieval fantasy, to high school romcoms, to dystopian survival, Japanese media became a source of entertainment — and an escape.

A picturesque lifestyle of Japan was sold. Going to school on the train. Walking through quiet neighborhoods stopping by a vending machine or *konbini* on the way. Cycling along rice paddies in quiet rural towns. Summer love songs about watching fireworks on a river bank. The halo got to me.

![Nano Banana Pro prompt: i want you to generate an idyllic anime style picture of rural japan... it should be a shot that is close to the ground of japanese style houses, with rice paddies nearby... it should be golden hour with long shadows cast by the houses and rice... a single lane road should bisect one of the rice paddies... add some vending machines on the side and some motorbikes parked near those houses... add some very distant mountains behind the farthest houses](/images/ai-japan.jpg#medium)

Maybe if I were into British murder mysteries or Brazilian telenovelas I'd be obsessed with British royalty or felt called by the Rio beaches. It's just I and millions of other young adults happened to have been ensnared by the country that created Pikachu.

## A bloody asterisk
I was born on the date of the Attack on Pearl Harbor — by this lucky coincidence I've been interested in the Second World War and its Pacific theater. I grew up watching documentaries, visiting museums, and reading memoirs and Wikipedia articles about the war — I'm deeply aware of Japan's role. 

Millions of civilians were massacred across the Asia-Pacific due to Japan's imperialistic ambitions. My young grandparents were part of a mass exodus of tens of millions of Chinese who fled their homes to escape the deadly occupation. The historical record shows the Japanese Empire being the *unequivocal* aggressor in the conflict. War criminals who perpetrated or tolerated these actions are still being worshipped in Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo. May history never forget their transgressions against humanity.

It's easy to think it was just the government who did those things, but a government at least partly reflects the will of the people. There was no protest or widespread condemnation of the military's actions. The view that other Asians were inferior was common. Whether we can hold an ill-informed and repressed society responsible for its government's actions isn't the focus of this post. It is however good to at least *think* if that could be the case, and whether the underlying views responsible for those horrors still persist to this day.

## a parade of generalizations
I've visited Japan twice now. The first time in January 2023 when I visited Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. The second time in January 2025 when I visited Tokyo, Hokkaido, and did a solo trip around Hiroshima. Through these travels I've gotten a small taste of Japan from a tourist perspective.

The following are a few aspects of the country and culture I admire.

#### pervasiveness of public transit
As someone moved by complexity, scale, and trains, the Japanese rail system is pure  eye candy. 

In the Tokyo metropolitan area alone, over 40 public and private rail operators transport 40 million people daily. The speed, orderliness, punctuality, scale, and efficiency required of the system to move one of the largest cities in the world is nothing short of a logistical and engineering marvel. The *single* 30 stop Yamanote line circling central Tokyo transports roughly 3 million people a day, more than five times the entire Washington DC metro.

Shinkansen (bullet train) lines criss-cross the country. It's considered *the* cost-effective and safe way to do medium-distance travel. In its 60+ years of operation not a single death has resulted from derailments or collisions. I took it myself both of my times in Japan. I remember checking my ticket's departure time, unsurprised every single one departed on time to the minute.

In the US we have pride in our freedom to have the ability to drive anywhere in our cars. In Japan, freedom is in the convenience and efficiency of being able to get anywhere in the country *without* needing a car.

#### everyday politeness
While taking the metro in Tokyo, I recall noticing a station attendant on duty right next the help desk near the fare gates. As each person scanned their IC cards to leave the station, the attendant said thank you and bowed. 

Japan is lauded for its politeness and respect. It's wired into the culture and even the language. Japanese has very different conjugations for verbs when being formal versus casual. An immense number of honorifics convey the very *flavor* of respect shown to guests, older people, and authority figures. 

You are treated with politeness even by somewhere as plain as a McDonalds. The effort Japanese people put into lower-wage work — the kind of jobs we in the US would say "don't get paid enough to care", is remarkable.

#### respect for food
Never mind my foray into an American fast food joint in Japan of all places. The Japanese are some of the most long-lived people in the world, and their diet and attitude towards food is part of the reason. 

One cold afternoon in Sapporo, Hokkaido a couple friends and I were getting hungry and specifically wanted udon. A quick search on Google Maps led to a run of the mill office building. Making our way through the little maze of a basement we stumbled across the inconspicuous udon restaurant. 

After we ordered on the ticket machine and seated, we handed our tickets to the server. Within 5 minutes our food was served. I got a set of hot udon and steaming curry rice served with a salad and pickled vegetables on the side. We happily ate our entire meal, showing due respect by cleaning every last bit. As we left the chef gave us a big customary thank you. Even after all of the meals I was still mildly surprised such a hole in the wall place could create such a good experience.

This might be the halo in full swing but there's a certain respect for food and its presentation. It's a combination of the sleekness of the dining spaces, the interactive ticket machines, and a general standard that any restaurant you go into will have good service and decent food.

#### hospitality & cleanliness
On my solo travel through Hiroshima in January 2025, I lived in numerous accommodations, most of which were pretty hole in the wall hostels or random rural inns. They all had one thing in common: every single one was *spotless*.

![My accomodation in Omishima, Imabari](/images/omishima-airbnb.png#medium)
Showers seemed shiny new, completely free of even a speck of mold. Common areas were neatly stacked with towels, water jugs, combs, and anything else you could need. There is a level of effort put into cleanliness and comfort I haven't spotted at the same level anywhere else I've been.

As I remarked in a journal entry:

>Something I’m appreciating from all this Japan travel is how attentive people are to small details, especially hospitality... It makes me want to incorporate that detail and hospitality into my own way of living.

Go to any city, you'll find the streets are nearly free of litter. You'll be equally amazed at how few public trash cans there are outside of train stations. It seems to be a quintessentially "Japan trip" moment of having a bunch of convenience store trash and being unable to find somewhere to toss it.

There's even those perennial news stories of civic-minded Japanese soccer fans sticking behind games abroad to pick up everyone else's trash. It's not something you hear about from any other country.

## Maybe not individually
None of these aspects are on their own anything special. Korea has risen to challenge Japan's cultural output in music and entertainment. Switzerland has an extensive and punctual train system. China has eight regional cuisines that arguably individually rival Japan's in diversity and scale. *Every* culture has its own unique way of showing hospitality and respect to guests.

Those aspects aren't without their downsides either. Japan's emphasis on respect reflects a rigid and misogynistic hierarchy. The politeness isn't personable — often people don't say what they actually think. Xenophobia is so rampant not speaking the language or not looking traditionally Japanese will leave you a second class citizen. The entertainment industry's strength is an indication of the daily slog caused by the oppressive work culture. Salarymen who long for their carefree youth hopelessly live in the escape that is anime or manga.

## But when they all meet...
Japan sits at the unique intersection of being an early and large cultural powerhouse, far enough removed from Western culture to be "exotic", technologically advanced to be novelly comfortable to tourists, and having a level of collective trust that screams "if only we could do this at home" to any visitor.

Underneath all of that is a close-minded, patriarchal, stifling, and racist society, many of the same traits that may have played a role in Japan's crimes in WW2.

I don't have the right to be a moral judge. I'm not asking that Japan should turn a new leaf and begin welcoming immigrants wholeheartedly. Three weeks in Japan is not enough to get a true perspective of the culture beyond the superficial tourist one. These are just thoughts I have, and thoughts anyone should consider before they go raving about how Japan is a utopia for quality of life.

In the end, I'm privileged to be able to visit and enjoy a country I don't *need* to see the bad side of. But just because Japan has that halo doesn't make it wrong to admire, discuss, and incorporate aspects we like into our own society.
