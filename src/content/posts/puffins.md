In April 2024 I went to Iceland with two close friends. It was our 2nd to last full day circling Iceland's iconic Ring Road. We had a decision to make.

## the gamble

One of the places we wanted to visit was the Látrabjarg cliffs at the far end of the Westfjords — one of the most remote regions of an already remote and largely rural country. The cliffs are known for their puffins.

We were unsurprisingly deciding the morning *day of* whether we'd make the drive there. There were multiple factors to consider. 

For one, it was about a 5 hour drive into one of the least accessible parts of the island. With stops, we would arrive in the afternoon — not so good when you have another 5 hour drive back. Our Toyota Yaris, trusty as it was, was not built for the sort of roads we'd be taking it on.

We were also tired from the constant new sights, experiences, physical exertion, and lack of quality food. We'd seen so many majestic mountains, fjords, and waterfalls the prospect of more of those sights was less appealing than it initially was. 

However, the main issue was April was too early in the season to see puffins. Some research indicated we would have to wait until May for any real chance; we'd most likely see a bunch of seagulls. Driving 10 hours round trip for the slim chance of seeing puffins couldn't really be justified by any reasonable person.

But we weren't reasonable people. 

I was the least up for it: ambivalent but leaning towards no, let's do it next time we're here. Max and *especially* Brandon both wanted to make the trek. A mantra that had arisen throughout the other stupid side quests on the trip was the delightfully Brandon-coined acronym "JNF" (job not finished). 

Almost two years later, I'm certain following it will continue to decrease my expected lifespan.

Majority rules so we decided on going. The above factors were reasonable but unimpressive excuses. We had already done a bunch of stupid things. We'd traveled thousands of miles from home and our study abroad homes to be here. We'd climbed [Mt. Brandy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/65%C2%B042'51.7%22N+16%C2%B043'49.9%22W/@65.7143448,-16.7322872,303m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d65.7143694!4d-16.7305333?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTIwOS4wIKXMDSoKLDEwMDc5MjA3M0gBUAM%3D) in deep snow. A long drive and being tired was the worst excuse to not take the chance at spotting such an iconic creature.

So we departed our Airbnb in search of those puffins. We drove through the rolling arctic tundra, anticipation that we were embarking on a final quest building.

As we approached the coast and the distant landscape revealed itself, we could see the rising fjords of the Westfjords across the grey water. It wasn't the majesty of the thundering falls, sublime glaciers, and the sprawling volcanic landscape we had seen the past few days, but there was nonetheless a grounded beauty to their gentle slopes and snow coated tops.

We stopped to get some food at a supermarket in a town called Búðardalur 1/3 of the drive in. It was a nice break where we could appreciate the bay views and reflect how far we'd come.

As we continued driving lane markings became infrequent. Road would occasionally turn to gravel then back to road. Towns were few and far between. Even other cars were a rare sight. We were beginning to feel the inhospitality of the Westfjords.

We stopped at many sites and overlooks along the way:

Kleifabúi, a large stone monument resembling a person erected by road construction workers 80 years ago. It was at a high point shrouded by clouds.

Garðar BA 64, a whaling ship wreck on the shores of one of those inlets. We climbed through and explored the entire structure, marveling at the age of the ship and worried that any wrong step could cause a tetanus-filled nightmare.

By the time we were about an hour out from the cliffs, the roads had become completely gravel and there were sections that didn't have any guardrails. Not focusing on the driving would've been deadly.

At this point I was the one driving, proceeding relatively slowly along the edge of the water with absolutely gorgeous views of the fjord. The clouds had cleared up and the sun began shimmering in the ocean and reflecting off the peaks. Now that we were right at the foot of — and across a narrow fjord from — these seemingly mythical landforms, their towering might had become apparent.

## a mistake and the best, stupid decision that followed 
With sheer cliff face to our left and open ocean to our right, I came across a soccer ball sized rock sitting smack in the middle of my path. Not thinking much of it and generally wanting to avoid steering far in either direction, I made one of the stupidest mistakes of all time: I drove over it. 

![The road quality the final hour of the drive](/images/westfjords-majesty.jpg#large)

Don't mind that we were in a Toyota Yaris, a hardy but minuscule city car that could barely fit us and our luggage; not exactly designed to have much ground clearance. Why would you need clearance to drive 25 mph downtown?

Well I drove right over that rock, or rather, I drove onto it. A large clunk emanated from the bottom of the Yaris, with several more smaller clunks as if the rock was trying and failing to be ground by a blender. The clunking sound continued for a couple minutes before it finally disappeared. Soon a metallic scraping sound replaced it. When the scraping didn't stop a mile later we finally took a step out to look at what was going on. 

I wish I had taken a picture of what we saw. A metal sheet at the bottom of the car had been bent backwards by the rock into a sideways U. The sound we were hearing was the bent metal being dragged along the gravel road.

![Not exactly an all terrain vehicle](/images/toyota-yaris.jpg#large)

At this point my unsettledness turned into internal panic. I had just torn open the underside of our car by driving over that rock. Now we could've been leaking fuel or oils or whatever. We were at least an hour away from the nearest town. Worst comes to worst, we'd have to try to call emergency services to pick us up in a place with no cellular service.

Now in the grand scheme of things was this a threat to our lives? Probably not. But it sure felt like if some braking or steering fluid had leaked, we'd careen over the edge of a cliff we couldn't brake or steer away from. I didn't know how car internals worked or if that was a reasonable assumption given the visible damage. 

To have this happen on our second to last day with our goal almost in sight was a pathetic end. I didn't want whoever would come rescue us to give us a chiding about foolishly driving a city car to this remote region. Just more fuel for the stupid tourists narrative.

We found a mound of dirt to jack up the car on one wheel so we could examine the underside's damage more closely, but even someone as car-uneducated as me knew actually crawling under was asinine.

At this point we could either proceed or go home dejectedly. Calling Icelandic 911 was not in the list of possible options. We'd call if our car actually started malfunctioning.

I wanted to go home. But I knew driving straight home would be no different than driving forward another hour if the car was actually broken. At the same time, any hydraulic fluid leakage could cause the car to be gradually less functional. The prospect of missing out on puffins — something, in my mind, we likely wouldn't see anyway was not worth the increased risk of continuing.

However, the guilt of having possibly ended our slim chances of seeing the puffins also weighed on me. What *if* they were there? I didn't WANT to go back, but my logical side knew continuing was objectively worse than going back.

Max was having second thoughts, but Brandon was as committed as he was from the beginning. Eventually both of them settled on continuing, so I begrudgingly gave in and we went onwards. It would prove to be one of the best (and stupid) decisions in all my adventures.

The sound of metal scraping against the road continued for the next 20 minutes. You can imagine how distressing that was.

## the puffins of Látrabjarg
The drive forward kept on getting more and more majestic. It was well into the afternoon so the sun was hanging low in the azure sky. The vast shadows the fjords cast on the deep blue water was spectacular.

At some point the metallic scraping sound disappeared. On inspection the metal had bent SO far back it now cleared the ground itself. The absurdity and resolution of the scraping noise was motivation to keep going.

We finally reached the cliffs to see a single other car at the parking lot. That wasn't surprising given how late in the day (6 pm) it was and it was still early season for tourism and puffins.

We climbed a snow covered trail to the cliffs. Ahead of us was 100% open ocean, something we really hadn't gotten to see with all the fjords on the way. It felt like we were on the edge of the known world, staring across the windswept ocean seeing what Vikings colonizing America would've seen. We'd made it.

![📸: max](/images/latrabjarg-cliffs2.jpg#large)

But our goal of seeing the puffins was elusive. We scanned the cliff faces, seeing countless white seagulls nested on the cliff face and soaring around; their endless squawks mixing with the drowning, restless wind. We kept looking for ages, all the while taking the pictures and video that was mandatory for finishing such a journey. More looking, but no puffins.

I was empty. In sort of defeatist, that's to be expected way. At some point that feeling became an almost resigned gratefulness. We had done so much on this trip. We climbed a glacier, saw *auroras*, went bathing in lagoons, and hiked a bunch of random mountains. We had done a lot, more than we could ask for, but not everything was meant to be.

Brandon was silent most of the time we were up there. He remarked a few times how disappointed and emotional he was. I secretly was too, but I thought it was no use hanging around miserable. We'd tried, and that's what mattered.

The windy cold was getting to us and not all of us had our thickest layers on so Max and I began trudging back to the car. 

As Max and I made it to the bottom of the trail, Brandon, still at the top, called out and frantically waved to us, but refused to elaborate when we inquired. A small "really??" rung in my head as I scrambled back up the snow covered trail, in disbelief but hopeful. It was now or never. Every second counted. 

As we emerged over the ridge we saw Brandon, phone in hand, recording a pair of puffins perched right below the edge of the cliff. In this moment we were overwhelmed with joy knowing we had won, and the next minute we stood in giddy silence recording them before they flew off.

![WE FOUND THEM](/images/puffins-victory.jpg#large)

Job finished. We had done what we set out to do. By such slim odds we had found the puffins of Látrabjarg. Suddenly the hidden disappointment of having driven 388 kilometers with nothing to show for it was gone.

## the return of the king (the king nearly died)

Our drive back was no less than treacherous. We were intensely tired from all the driving and dreaded the drive to come.

We came back across the same patch of frozen snow that we had encountered on the way to the cliffs. The patch was deep but had two indented tire tracks we'd have to fit our car through. As before, Brandon and I had to leave the car to guide Max through after the underside got stuck on the ice.

As we were getting back into the car, we noticed a shiny piece of something lying in the snow that wasn't there before. 

It was the bent sheet of metal from the underside of the car. It had been torn clean off, its mangled form resting on the ice. Our celebratory mood immediately took on an absurdly comical undertone.

![I'm dead](/images/yaris-piece.jpg#large)

On the way back, we found the rock that had caused the damage to the Yaris and the source of the previous hours of anxiety. In a moment of poetic triumph, we tossed the rock back into the ocean, ending the threat to other unsuspecting drivers and closing that chapter of the story.

Max had to take a work call at the Kleifabúi monument we stopped at earlier. We enjoyed our last sunset in Iceland, and my goodness that was one of the most gorgeous sunsets I had ever seen. 

![Kleifabúi gazing at the sunset (📸: brandy)](/images/statue-sunset-iceland.jpg#large)

We actually saw the Northern lights again, our second time after the initial viewing in Egilsstaðir out in the east. It was a brief wisp of aurora borealis but not any less magical.

![Sliver of an aurora we spotted](/images/aurora-westfjords.jpg#large)

The night drive back went from joyous to treacherous to hallucinatory. Max and I took turns driving while Brandon slept in the back. He's almost certainly indignant reading this — I concede he helped on the drive there immensely. 

Max and I held the fort down, instantly slipping into comas each time we traded places every hour. By the time we were 10 minutes out from our accommodation, Max heaved a huge groan and said he had to get off. We were so tired that neither of us could hold out for an additional few miles without falling asleep. Brandon took the wheel and finished the job.

I don't mean it lightly when I say we almost died that day. From the car missing a piece, to the perilous route, to the fact we were about to fall asleep on top of all of that. The quest for puffins was one of the most dangerous things I've ever done.

We returned the fully insured car two days later. "A piece of the car is in the trunk by the way."

## the ending we chose
Even if we turned back early after only seeing seagulls, maybe everything would've been alright. We would've accepted that we "tried", bemoaning fate wasn't ours that day. 

But to not try your hardest at what you want is accepting mediocrity. That day, Brandon remained on the cliff as everyone else gave up. The puffins of Iceland were there.

You won't get what you want without believing in it. So believe, even foolishly, like your life depends on it.
