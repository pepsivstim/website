## coding vibez

I've done it. I've finally downloaded [an agentic development platform](https://antigravity.google/) to vibe code. I've been holding out (for no particular reason) until now, and I'm impressed.

In my personal life I ask AI about opinions, recipes, current events — I even ask it to guess songs I can't Shazam. It's approaching a level of use some people might judge me for. Regardless, the way I acquire knowledge has significantly changed.

This might not be a good thing. But that's a discussion for later.

As a software engineer I'm worried about how AI will transform my profession. The existence of *this* project is a testament to the tool's usefulness for frontend development. It allowed me to spin up a website effortlessly — what would've taken me 2-3x longer to do on my own. The speed of iterating on my ideas is blazing. Being able to describe what I want in words and molding my vision in near real-time is a remarkable experience. It's as simple as: hey I want my photos to expand when I hover my mouse now, add it — and it does it. Even as I type this, my agent is busy adding features. Basically Ironman.

## why blog?
I've always been a big journaler, ever since I wrote my first entry in a Google Doc in middle school. Writing my thoughts down has been one of my most treasured tools for self-reflection and improvement. Yet blogging has never been something I've seriously considered doing. 

Journaling and blogging are the private and public sides of the same coin. It's just that for the latter the intended audience is more than the single person that is you.

My writing and self-reflection skills have undoubtedly grown stronger with my extensive journaling. In the age of AI, being able to express ourselves will only become more important as our thoughts, emotions, and experiences are what sets us apart from those machines (I wish you no harm 🫣). Bettering those skills has never been more valuable.

Blogging however requires a different set of writing skills than journaling. There is no proofreading in journaling as you can generally understand your own convoluted chain of thought and grammar mistakes. With blogging, constant revisions are necessary to make sure you can be understood by the most people. Precise vocabulary and detailed descriptions enhance meaning in sentences and elevate writing to an art. Writing for others is a deeply empathetic (and performative) exercise.

Enough yapping — the reason I started the blog is I have cool thoughts and experiences I want to share. Sharing is one of the most innately human traits, and text happens to be my preferred medium to do so.

In the age of recommendation algorithms and scroll feeds, we aren't just provided information. We are force fed it on the daily. To consume a blog is much more intentional. I don't expect many (if any) to willingly come this far, but thanks if you do.

Maybe this is just my shout into the void of the internet: a desperate attempt to show that I have meaning and significance when the numbers say otherwise. But as long as anyone — including myself — finds value in this, I'll continue to do it.

So really, it's the intersection of learning a useful vibe coding tool and my desire to remain *human* in a world of AI and mindless consumption that brings me here. To the first of many!
